# DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HARM SOMEONE MIGHT CAUSE WITH THIS APPLICATION

C# Windows application that can control mouse, perform keyboard clicks, close running processes, log user's key presses, take screenshots and update itself.

This app is controled using a JSON configuration file which is located on the server side. (Source code of the server: https://github.com/Giedrius-Kristinaitis/User_Tracking_App_Web_Server)

All collected information is sent to a web server that is capable of receiving it. 
The actual address of my web server is not in the source code because I do not want anything unnecessay reaching it.

Without a web server this application is useless.
